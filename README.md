Code and data for harvesting images and metadata from the Rijksmuseum, doing
color and entropy analysis and thumbnail creation (also uploading to S3) for the
Cooper-Hewitt's experimental "Rijkscolors" feature.

These are provided as-is, more of a reference implementation and a toolbox than
anything you might use without modifications. We’ve put it all on GitHub and we
welcome your suggestions and fixes.
